KIRSTEN INITIAL EMAIL: Dec 21, 2016
This is scrap/research I copied/pasted/reorganized to suit my needs in terms of seeing how this could map out. Things would need to be rewritten and are wide open to adding/rearranging/cutting/anything. This was just so I could see IF there was enough to build a picture book with. And I decided hell yes! 
Ways to approach:
1) "You open your eyes for the very first time. You're only a newborn, so you can't see clearly just yet. Bit if you could, you would see your parents gazing at you lovingly. You father is a ..."
2) "My name is [insert name.] And this was me, the day I was born. I was just a newborn, so my eyes couldn't see clearly yet. But if they could have, I'd have seen..." (Maybe this approach is better than #1!)
2) However you want!
Informational but told in a way that we connect with the boy. Faraway Fox did I great job of blending real/nonfiction information with a personal POV. The editor actually called it "emotive nonfiction"â€”which I loved!
Looking forward to getting started. Glad you're game!

6-7
For almost 700 years, between the 9th and 16th centuries, knights were the lords of the battlefield, admired and respected for their abilities and their chivalry and courage.
8-9
So, how did a boy in these centuries become a knight? (Art: boy in with many knights, looking lost and eager and hopeful)
10-11
Becoming a knight was a tradition that changed over the centuries of the middle ages and by around the sixteenth century, with the advent of gunpowder and firearms, had pretty much become just a symbolic title. But there was a commonly accepted normal route that a boy could take in his quest to become a knight during the height of the Middle Ages when knighthood was important.
12-13
The first requirement for a boy to become a knight was the requirement of his heritage. Generally, only boys born to certain men were allowed the opportunity to become a knight. These requirements were usually that the boy be the son of a knight, Lord, a wealthy merchant, or someone who held title and position in the court of the king or a lord.
(Sample art note: baby being born, parents looking lovingly and proudly, dad maybe already dressed as a knight.)
14-15
Contrary to popular belief, the king did not usually train boys to become knights. This was the responsibility of the kingâ€™s lords, barons and knights. Each of these men held stations, titles, lands and manors of his own. And it was to the lordâ€™s manor that the boy would go to train under the knight of the king.
16-17
At around the age of six or seven a boy, who was of noble lineage, would report to the local lordâ€™s castle or manor to begin his training as a knight.
18-19
There he would learn a host of basic skills to make him a well-rounded and educated knight. He would learn the fundamentals of court life such as table manners, care and maintenance of armor and weapons, and how to care for a horse. 
20-21
He would also learn how to read and how to appreciate music or even play the lute. And his training would include martial arts with his learning how to hunt and how to hawk.
22-23 
At around the age of thirteen, as the boy is starting to develop the body, mentality, strength and abilities of manhood he is promoted to squire. He is then assigned as the personal assistant to a knight and it is in this time that he focuses on the combat arms of knighthood. 
24-25
He would get intensive training in weapons, armor, tactics and mounted combat. Often times he was allowed to carry a small sword and shield with him as a symbol of his status as a squire or a â€œknight in trainingâ€.
26-27 
The ceremony of becoming a knight was something that could often last several days and could include fasting or a Vigil where the knight would engage in prayer and contemplation for a day and a night or longer. Then there would often be elaborate feasts and hardy discussions with lords and knights about chivalry, courage, religion, and the nature of being a knight. During the actual knighting ceremony the knight would swear allegiance to God and to his lord and he would receive presents such as a sword, a pair of spurs, armor, and a cloak. 
28-29
At the end of the ceremony the king would tap the squire on the shoulders with the flat of a sword blade and he would become a knight.
30-31
Maybe something here back to original ltitle boy dreaming of becoming a knight. Something to stop and give pause to the reader. Bring the book full circle. Something aspirational.
32
An extra final, solo page image, wordless, a vignetted image maybe of a little boy in bed dreaming of his future some day as a knight, to show what a dream this role is/was for little boys.

There were two ways that a man could become a knight during the Middle Ages. The first was earning the right on the battlefield. If a soldier fought particularly bravely during a battle or war, he may be awarded knighthood by the king, a lord, or even another knight. The second way was to become an apprentice to a knight and earn the title through hard work and training. 

Who could become a knight? No doubt many young men growing up in the Middle Ages dreamed of becoming a knight, but only a few could afford to become knights. The first requirement of a knight was someone who could afford a knight's weapons, armor, and war horse. These items weren't cheap and only the very rich could pay for them.

Knights were also people from the noble or aristocratic classes.
Page
When a boy, or more likely his parents, decided that he wanted to become a knight, he would go to live in the household of a knight when he was seven years old. There he would serve the knight as a page. As a young page he basically was a servant for the knight, performing tasks such as serving meals, cleaning his clothes, and carrying messages. While working for the knight's household, the page learned the proper way to behave and good manners. The page also began to train to fight. He would practice with other pages using wooden shields and swords. He also would start to learn how to ride a horse using no hands and carrying a lance.
Squire
Around the age of fifteen, the page would become a squire. As a squire, the young man would have a new set of tasks. He would take care of the knight's horses, clean his armor and weapons, and accompany the knight to the battlefield. Squires had to be ready to fight. They trained with real weapons and were taught fighting skills by the knight. They had to be in good shape and strong. Squires continued to practice their horsemanship, perfecting their skills at jousting and fighting from the saddle. Most future knights worked as a squire for five or six years.
Dubbing Ceremony
If a squire had proven his bravery and skill at battle, he would become a knight at the age of twenty-one. He gained the title of knight at a "dubbing" ceremony. At this ceremony he would kneel before another knight, lord, or king who would then tap the squire on the shoulder with his sword making him a knight. At the ceremony, the new knight would take an oath to honor and protect his king and the church. He would be presented with a pair of riding spurs and a sword.
Interesting Facts about Becoming a Knight
Squires often learned about castle and siege warfare from their knight. They would need to know how to defend their own castle as well as how to attack an enemy's castle. The word "squire" comes from a French word meaning "shield-bearer." Wealthy knights would have had several pages and squires to assist them. Squires would practice jousting using a wooden dummy called a quintain. Not all squires were made knights through an elaborate ceremony. Some were awarded knighthood on the battlefield. Before the dubbing ceremony to become a knight, squires were required to spend the night alone in prayer.


http://history.howstuffworks.com/historical-figures/knight2.htm

The boys who trained to be knights were generally the sons of knights or lords. (In some cases, the sons of commoners could train for knighthood -- as in the movie "A Knight's Tale.") These children were cared for by the women of the castle until they turned 7, when they were placed in the house of another lord or knight. There, they were bestowed with the title of page. Huntsmen and falconers taught them how to hunt, and priests or chaplains taught them religion, reading and writing. Pages learned to fight by imitating knights and practiced combat with each other using wooden swords and lances.
When a page turned 14, he could become an esquire (or, more simply, squire). In a religious ceremony, the new squire took a consecrated sword from a bishop or priest and swore to use it for religious and honorable purposes. After this ceremony, the squire took his place in his lord's household and attended to his duties. There were different squires for specific duties.

	•	The squire of the body was the personal servant of a knight or his lady.
	•	The squire of the chamber, or chamberlain, attended to the rooms of the castle.
	•	The carving squire, or table squire, carved the meat and attended to the banquet tables.
	•	The squire of the wines managed the wine cellar.
	•	The squire of the pantry stocked and kept track of household goods in the pantry.
	•	The squire of arms cleaned and maintained the armor and swords.
	•	The squire of honor assisted the lord in all ceremonies and feasts.
During this period of squiring, the would-be knight learned to serve and mastered the intricacies of social behavior and chivalry.
Besides carrying out their duties in the lord's household, squires learned the martial arts of being a knight. They learned how to handle horses and continued practicing with wooden swords and lances -- sometimes with the knights themselves. They wore chain-mail armor to get used to its weight (and sometimes even danced in hauberks, or chain-mail shirts). As they got older, they exercised and trained in full armor. Squires would also assist the knights in combat, at tournaments and in travel to foreign lands (carrying and cleaning armor, taking care of the knight's horses, packing baggage).
Upon turning 21, a squire was ready to be knighted.Â­Â­

Female Knights
In the Middle Ages, women didn't usually have the opportunity to become knights. However, there were a few exceptions:
	•	In 1149, women who had helped defend the Spanish town of Tortosa from the Moors were inducted into an order of knights called the Order of the Hatchet (which didn't survive beyond its original membership).
	•	The Order of St. John the Hospitaller inducted warrior "nuns."
	•	The Knights Templar also had a class of warrior nuns shortly before all the Templars were accused of heresy and burned.
	•	Women, usually wives of knights and nobles, were inducted into the Order of the Garter in England between 1358 and 1488. There were no further appointments until modern times.
	•	After the French Revolution, French women could be inducted into the Legion d'Honneur.
	•	The Order of the Star of India inducted a woman named Nawab Begum in 1861. Later, her daughter and Queen Mary were granted knighthood in this order.
	•	Today, women can be granted knighthood in British orders. The proper salutation for a female knight is "dame" (think of Dame Judi Dench, the actress).

Becoming a Knight
Knighthood training was a long and often arduous process. Knighthood training began in early childhood when a basic education and good manners and rules of etiquette were taught at home. At the age of 7 young boys were sent away to the castles and homes of wealthy lords or relatives to embark on their knighthood training. From the age of seven to fourteen these young boys were given the role of a Medieval Page. From fourteen to twenty-one these 'apprentice knights' were referred to as Squires . The different types and styles of Knighthood training depended on the age and strength of the apprentice knights. Knighthood training was focussed on weapon practise which included enhancing skills in horsemanship, the two-handed sword, battle axe, mace, dagger and lance.

Becoming a Knight - The Medieval Page
The Medieval Page of the Middle Ages was little more than a child. But his training commenced from the age of seven. The duties of a knight were seen as the combat duties and those duties related to serving the lords and ladies. The Knighthood training began in earnest as a Page when all their games and sports were geared towards learning skills related to horsemanship, the two-handed sword, battle axe, mace, dagger and lance. Obviously dangerous weapons were not used by these young boys! Great emphasis was placed on physical fitness and strength. A Page would start to acquire the skills required of a Knight by practising the skills of tilting a lance during their knighthood training. A target was erected and the Page would mount a wooden 'horse' on wheels holding a lance. The wooden horse would be pulled along by two other pages towards the target and the page would aim the lance. The Page was expected to learn the technique called the 'couch' where the lance is held under the arm to steady it during a course, substantially reducing the amount of flex and increasing the accuracy of a lunge. Sword play was practised using wooden swords and shields. Fighting on piggyback introduced the young knights to the balance and skills required in mounted combat. Becoming a Knight in other physical skills included climbing, swimming, throwing stones, javelins, archery and wrestling.

Becoming a Knight - Equestrian Skills
The knighthood training of both the Pages and the Squires of the Middle Ages continued with acquiring excellent equestrian skills. A horse played an extremely important part in the life of a knight. A knight would own several horses which were built for different duties. These knights ranged in various sizes starting with a palfrey, or an ambler for general travelling purposes. Bigger and stronger horses were required as warhorses. The Courser was the most sought after and expensive warhorse, owned by the most wealthy knights. The more common warhorses were like modern hunters, known then as Destriers. The apprentice knights would learn how to ride and control their horses and the art of this type of warfare. Starting with small ponies they would hone their equestrian skills in their Knighthood training. The pages and squires were also expected to play their part of caring for the horses in the stables.

Becoming a Knight - The Medieval Squire
The Medieval Squire of the Middle Ages was aged between fourteen and twenty-one. They had served as pages and learnt the basic skills required during their Knighthood training. As Squires they were seen as men capable of fighting in battles. Their Knighthood training became far more dangerous. Injuries were a common occurrence during their knighthood training. Their skills with the lance had to be perfected. The tool used in the practice of the lance was called called the quintain. The quintain consisted of a shield and dummy which was suspended from a swinging pole. When the shield was hit by a charging squire, the whole apparatus would rotate. The squire's task was to avoid the rotating arms and not get knocked from his saddle. A variation of the quintain added heavy swinging sandbags which also had to be avoided. Accuracy was also an important factor and squires practised "Running at the Rings" where the lance was aimed at a target in the shape of a ring - these rings were obviously much smaller to lance than a man and this skill was therefore difficult to master. Fighting with quarterstaffs could also result in injuries. Fighting with swords and other weapons were strictly supervised and only wooden, blunt or covered weapons were used. General fitness levels had to be high and the strength of an apprentice knight was expected, regardless of size.

Becoming a Knight - Castle and Siege Warfare
Siege warfare was a common occurrence during the Medieval times. An important requirement to capture the enemies power base - their castles. Becoming a Knight included learning about the strategy, process and weapons used in siege warfare. Siege Warfare during the Medieval times of the Middle Ages was conducted according to Chivalric Rules and a truce or settlement would always be attempted, according to the Chivalric Code before Siege Warfare commenced. Knighthood training included all of these aspects of siege warfare. The Squires would be expected to understand the options available when defending a castle - the layout and traps included in the castle design. A young squire, or even a page, would be expected to defend a castle according to their skills and strength. A crossbow might be issued to a squire or page as it required minimum strength and few skills to operate. Attacking a castle would also be studied. This would include learning about Siege Weapons - the Trebuchet, Ballista, Mangonel, Battering Ram and Siege Towers. Skills in climbing were important - scaling castle walls. Knighthood training would also include the process of undermining a castle.

Becoming a Knight - Qualities of a Knight
During his long period of Knighthood training a squire or page must also learn bravery and the ability to withstand extremes in cold and heat, tiredness and hunger. It was not all hard work. The apprentice knights also enjoyed attending tournaments - great fun for these young men

Women Knights in the Middle Ages
Were there women knights in the Middle Ages? Initially I thought not, but further research yielded surprising answers. There were two ways anyone could be a knight: by holding land under a knight's fee, or by being made a knight or inducted into an order of knighthood. There are examples of both cases for women.
Female Orders of Knighthood
The Order of the Hatchet
There is a case of a clearly military order of knighthood for women. It is the order of the Hatchet (orden de la Hacha) in Catalonia. It was founded in 1149 by Raymond Berenger, count of Barcelona, to honor the women who fought for the defense of the town of Tortosa against a Moor attack. The dames admitted to the order received many privileges, including exemption from all taxes, and took precedence over men in public assemblies. I presume the order died out with the original members.
Here is a description taken from Ashmole, The Institution, Laws, and Ceremony of the Most Noble Order of the Garter (1672), Ch. 3, sect. 3:
"The example is of the Noble Women of Tortosa in Aragon, and recorded by Josef Micheli Marquez, who plainly calls them Cavalleros or Knights, or may I not rather say Cavalleras, seeing I observe the words Equitissae and Militissae (formed from the Latin Equites and Milites) heretofore applied to Women, and sometimes used to express Madams or Ladies,though now these Titles are not known.
"Don Raymond, last Earl of Barcellona (who by intermarriage with Petronilla, only Daughter and Heir of King Ramiro the Monk, united that principality to the Kingdom of Aragon) having in the year 1149, gained the City of Tortosa from the Moors, they on the 31 of December following, laid a new Siege to that place, for the recovery of it out of the Earls hands. The Inhabitants being a length reduced to gread streights, desired relief of the Earl, but he, being not in a condition to give them any, they entertained some thoughts of making a surrender. Which the Women hearing of, to prevent the disaster threatning their City, themselves, and Children, put on mens Clothes, and by a resolute sally, forced the Moors to raise the Siege.
"The Earl, finding himself obliged, bythe gallentry of the action, thought fit to make his acknowlegements thereof, by granting them several Privileges and Immunities, and to perpetuate the memory of so signal an attempt, instituted an Order, somewhat like a Military Order, into which were admitted only those Brave Women, deriving the honor to their Descendants, and assigned them for a Dadge, a thing like a Fryars Capouche, sharp at the top, after the form of a Torch, and of a crimson colour, to be worn upon their Head-clothes. He also ordained, that at all publick meetings, the women should have precedence of the Men. That they should be exempted from all Taxes, adn that all the Apparel and Jewels, though of never so great value, left by their dead Husbands, should be their own.
"These Women (saith our Author) having thus aquired this Honor by their personal Valour, carried themselves after the Military Knights of those days." Jeanne Hachette, who fought to repel a Burgundian assault on the town of Beauvais in 1472. The King exempted her from taxes, and ordered that, in an annual procession to commemorate the event, women would have precedence over men. This story seems to be a carbon copy of the Order of the Hatchet story...
In Italy, the Order of the glorious Saint Mary, founded by Loderigo d'Andalo, a nobleman of Bologna in 1233, and approved by pope Alexander IV in 1261, was the first religious order of knighthood to grant the rank of militissa to women. This order was suppressed by Sixtus V in 1558.
In the Low Countries, at the initiative of Catherine Baw in 1441, and 10 years later of Elizabeth, Mary and Isabella of the house of Hornes, orders were founded which were open exclusively to women of noble birth, who received the French title of chevaliÃ¨re or the Latin title of equitissa. In his Glossarium (s.v. militissa), Du Cange notes that still in his day (17th c.), the female canons of the canonical monastery of St. Gertrude in Nivelles (Brabant), after a probation of 3 years, are made knights (militissae) at the altar, by a (male) knight called in for that purpose, who gives them the accolade with a sowrd and pronounces the usual words.
In England, ladies were appointed to the Garter almost from the start. In all, 68 ladies were appointed between 1358 and 1488, including all consorts. Though many were women of royal blood, or wives of knights of the Garter, some women were neither. They wore the garter on the left arm, and some are shown on their tombstones with this arrangement. After 1488, no other appointments are known, although it is said that the Garter was granted to a Neapolitan poetess, Laura Bacio Terricina, by Edward VI. In 1638, a proposal was made to revive the use of robes for the wives of knights in ceremonies, but it came to nought. (See Edmund Fellowes, Knights of the Garter, 1939; and Beltz: Memorials of the Order of the Garter).
Unless otherwise noted, all the above is from the book by H. E. Cardinale, Orders of Knighthood, Awards and the Holy See, 1983. The info on the order of the Hatchet is reproduced elsewhere as well, e.g., a Spanish encyclopedia. I have seen the order of glorious Saint Mary discussed elsewhere, but without mention of women. I have yet to identify the orders of the Hornes family.
Women in the Military Orders
Several established military orders had women who were associated with them, beyond the simple provision of aid. The Teutonic order accepted consorores who assumed the habit of the order and lived under its rule; they undertook menial and hospitaller functions. Later, in the late 12th century, one sees convents dependent on military orders are formed. In the case of the Order of Saint-John (later Malta), they were soeurs hospitaliÃ¨res, and they were the counterparts of the frÃ¨res prÃªtres or priest brothers, a quite distinct class from the knights. In England, Buckland was the site of a house of Hospitaller sisters from Henry II's reign to 1540. In Aragon, there were Hospitaller convents in Sigena, San Salvador de Isot, GrisÃ©n, Alguaire, headed each by a commendatrix. In France they are found in Beaulieu (near Cahors), Martel and Fieux. The only other military order to have convents by 1300 was the order of Santiago, which had admitted married members since its foundation in 1175. and soon women were admitted and organized into convents of the order (late 12th, early 13th c.). The convents were headed by a commendatrix (in Spanish: commendadora) or prioress. There were a total of six in the late 13th century: Santa Eufenia de Cozuelos in northern Castile, San Spiritu de Salamanca, Santos-o-Vello in Portugal, Destriana near Astorga, San Pedro de la Piedra near LÃ©rida, San Vincente de Junqueres. The order of Calatrava also had a convent in San Felices de los Barrios.

Women Knights
Medieval French had two words, chevaleresse and chevaliÃ¨re, which were used in two ways: one was for the wife of a knight, and this usage goes back to the 14th c. The other was as female knight, or so it seems. Here is a quote from Menestrier, a 17th c. writer on chivalry: "It was not always necessary to be the wife of a knight in order to take this title. Sometimes, when some male fiefs were conceded by special privilege to women, they took the rank of chevaleresse, as one sees plainly in Hemricourt where women who were not wives of knights are called chevaleresses."
I could find no trace of any title bestowed on Jeanne d'Arc. Her family was made noble, with nobility transmissible through women, which was quite unusual. She did ride a horse and dress up in armor, but she did not wield a sword and never killed anyone, but rather grasped her banner pretty tightly.

Female Grand-Cross in the ORder of Saint John
In 1645, when a Turkish fleet threatened the island of Malta, a French nobleman, Louis d'Arpajon (1601-79), called his vassals, raised an army of 2000 men, found ships and provisions and sailed for Malta. On 27 July 1645, a grateful Grand Master granted to him and his eldest son the right to wear and to bear in his arms a cross of Malta, and to one of his younger sons the right to be admitted as a minor in the order and to be promoted grand cross at the age of 18; furthermore this privilege was to be transmitted to his successors as head of his house, and in case of extinction of the male line it would pass to females. (See his arms).
This privilege was The male line became extinct with his grandson Louis d'Arpajon, knight of the Golden Fleece, who died in 1736. He left a daughter Anne-Claude-Louise d'Arpajon (1729-94) who married Philippe de Noailles, comte de Noailles, baron de Mouchy (1715-94). She was received Grand-Cross on 13 Dec 1745 in Paris by the ambassador of the Order, and her husband was received 17 Nov 1750 (he was also knight of the St Esprit 1767, knight of the Golden Fleece 1746, and marÃ©chal de France 1775, grandee of Spain 1st class 1741, styled duc de Mouchy 1747. (source: La Chesnaye-Desbois; the prÃ©sident HÃ©nault, maternal uncle of the countess of Noailles, witnessed her reception and mentions it in his MÃ©moires, p. 146.).
Their younger son Louis-Marie, vicomte de Noailles (1756-1804) was called to the privilege. He married his cousin the daughter of the duc d'Ayen and had among others a younger son Alfred-Louis-Dominique (1784-1812), baron of the French Empire, whose only daughter by his cousin Charlotte de Noailles de Mouchy was Anne-Charlotte-CÃ©cile (d. 1858). She married Charles-Philippe-Henri de Noailles, duc de Mouchy, and their son Antonin-Just-LÃ©on-Marie (1841-1909) was grand-cross of St. John. The Gotha FranÃ§ais also names his grandson and successor Henry, duc de Mouchy (1890-1947) as grand-cross, but does not say if the privilege continued.
HÃ©nault adds that (in his time, c. 1750), there were only three other female grand-crosses: the "princesse de Rochette in Italy", the princess of Thurn and Taxis (Maria Ludovika von Lobkowicz, 1683-1750), and her daughter Maria Augusta von Thurn und Taxis, duchess of Wurttemberg ((1706-56).
Modern Women Knights
Modern French orders include women, of course, in particular the LÃ©gion d'Honneur (Legion of Honor) since the mid-19th c., but they are always called chevaliers. The first documented case is that of Marie-AngÃ©lique Duchemin (1772-1859), who fought in the Revolutionary Wars, received a military disability pension in 1798, the rank of 2nd lieutenant in 1822, and the Legion of Honor in 1852.
Traditionally, French women on whom the LÃ©gion d'Honneur or other order is conferred use the title "chevalier." However, a recipient of the Ordre National du MÃ©rite recently requested from the order's Chancery the permission to call herself "chevaliÃ¨re" and the request was granted (AFP dispatch, Jan 28, 2000).
The first woman to be granted a knighthood in modern Britain seems to have been H.H. Nawab Sikandar Begum Sahiba, Nawab Begum of Bhopal, who became a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) in 1861, at the foundation of the order. Her daughter received the same honour in 1872, and granddaughter in 1910. The order was open to "princes and chiefs" without distinction of gender. (Thanks to Christopher Buyers for this item).

The first European woman to have been granted an order of knighthood was Queen Mary, when she was made a Knight Grand Commander of the same order, by special statute, in celebration of the Delhi Durbar of 1911. She was also granted a knighthood in 1917, when the Order of the British Empire was created (the first order explicitly open to women). The Royal Victorian Order was opened to women in 1936, the Order of Bath and Saint Michael and Saint George in 1965 and 1971 respectively. Queen consorts have been made Ladies of the Garter since 1901 (Queens Alexandra in 1901, Mary in 1910, Elizabeth in 1937). The first non-Royal woman to be made Lady Companion of the Garter was Lavinia, duchess of Norfolk in 1990 (â€ 1995), the second was Baroness Thatcher in 1995 (post-nominal: LG). On Nov. 30, 1996, Marion Ann Forbes, Lady Fraser was made Lady of the Thistle, the first non-Royal woman (post-nominal: LT).
